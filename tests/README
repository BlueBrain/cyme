The test Na.cpp check the good execution of the framework for a channel Na.
But it does not check the results. Deep verifications is performs into the unit
tests, where every tests is performs for AoSoA and AoS and compared using a
a given epsilon in test_header.hpp. At least it checks if the given assembly
works on the compiled platform.

Na.cpp
test: main
   - This test executes the Na channel, for cyme vector,  all layouts i.e. AoS, AoSoA, float and double.
     This regression test checks results obtain with AoSoA (with cyme.math) to AoS layout (with compiler.math).

To compile the test (x86) you will have to fix dependencies (paths!) nevertheless I provide a example for avx, an unroll factor of 4 without fma. The main is built over boost.test so
do not forget to make appropirate link

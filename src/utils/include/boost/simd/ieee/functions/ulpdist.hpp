    Returns ulp distance of the two values.

    @par Semantic:

    @code
    T r = ulpdist(a0,a1);
    @endcode

    is similar to:

    @code
    T r = abs(x-y)/Eps<T>();
    @endcode

    @par Note:

    If the common type is integer it is the same as @c dist

    If the common type is floating point the ulpdist is is computed,
    by the above described method:

    It is often difficult to  answer to the following question:
    "are these two floating computations results similar enough?"

    The ulpdist is a way to answer which is tuned for relative errors estimations
    and peculiarly adapted to cope with the limited bits accuracy of floating point
    representations.
    The method is the following:

    Properly normalize the two numbers by the same factor in a way that
    the largest of the two numbers exponents will be brought to zero
    Return the absolute difference of these normalized numbers
    divided by the rounding error Eps

    The roundind error is the ulp (unit in the last place) value, i.e. the
    floating number, the exponent of which is 0 and the mantissa is all zeros
    but a 1 in the last digit (it is not hard coded that way however).
    This means 2^-23 for floats and 2^-52 for double

    \arg For instance if two floating numbers (of same type) have an ulpdist of
    zero that means that their floating representation are identical.

    \arg Generally equality up to 0.5 ulp is the best that one can wish beyond
    strict equality.

    \arg Typically if a double is compared to the float representation of
    its floating conversion (they are exceptions as for fully representable
    reals) the ulpdist will be around 2^26.5 (~10^8)

    The ulpdist is also roughly equivalent to the number of representable
    floating points values between two given floating points values.

    \arg  @c ulpdist(1.0,1+Eps\<double\>())==0.5
    \arg  @c ulpdist(1.0,1+Eps\<double\>()/2)==0.0
    \arg  @c ulpdist(1.0,1-Eps\<double\>()/2)==0.25
    \arg  @c ulpdist(1.0,1-Eps\<double\>())==0.5
    \arg  @c ulpdist(double(Pi\<float\>()),Pi\<double\>())==9.84293e+07

 *
 * \par Description
 *  See Knuth, Art Of Computer Programming, Vol. 1, Problem 1.2.4-5.
 *
 *  Tolerant FLOOR function.
 *
 *    X  -  is given as a Double Precision argument to be operated on.
 *          It is assumed that X is represented with M mantissa bits.
 *    CT -  is   given   as   a   Comparison   Tolerance   such   that
 *          0.LT.CT.LE.3-SQRT(5)/2. If the relative difference between
 *          X and A whole number is  less  than  CT,  then  TFLOOR  is
 *          returned   as   this   whole   number.   By  treating  the
 *          floating-point numbers as a finite ordered set  note  that
 *          the  heuristic  EPS=2.**(-(M-1))   and   CT=3*EPS   causes
 *          arguments  of  TFLOOR/TCEIL to be treated as whole numbers
 *          if they are  exactly  whole  numbers  or  are  immediately
 *          adjacent to whole number representations.  Since EPS,  the
 *          "distance"  between  floating-point  numbers  on  the unit
 *          interval, and M, the number of bits in X'S mantissa, exist
 *          on  every  floating-point   computer,   TFLOOR/TCEIL   are
 *          consistently definable on every floating-point computer.

**Google Summer Code 2015**

This file summurized the work of the student Kai Langen on the update ot the Cyme library for the Power/arm architecture 
during the Google Summer Code 2015. The BlueBrain project applies the Agile software development methodology, therefore
the work is summurized per sprint (3 consecutives weeks).

**Sprint 7, May 11th - 28th**
  - Read documentation and general questions about the library
  - Following my advices, Kai prepared the backend and modify the trait classes
  - The Power infrastructure back end is ready, API and assert(false) in all functions
  - 2^x and 10^x are implemented correctly with the corresponding tests, documentation, merge in master
  - log_2 and log_10 are implemented correctly with the corresponding tests, documentation, merge in master

**Sprint 8, june 1st - 18th**
  - Connection front/end, first contact with the remote enviromment 
  - Compile the empty backend [ok], ready to start
  - all wrapper are filled except call to IBM mass library
  - all tests work except tests related to log and exp
  - exp wrappers work

**Sprint 9, june 18th - july 2nd**
  - log float has been fixed
  - log double pbs are identified, work in progress
  - Merge the Power7/8 backend in the master, **the main objective of the GGSC is accomplished**
  - Print functions for all vectors classes, merge in the master
  - Implement the backbone of the ARM backend, it compiles

**Sprint 10, july 2nd - 23rd**
  - Merge the ARM backend in the master, **the first optional objective of the GGSC is accomplished**
  - Start the trigonometric implementations (sinus)
  - Sin x86 SSE/AVX works, with corresponding tests
  - Add absolute value in the DAG 

**Sprint 12, july 24rd - august 14th**
  - Start cos/tan SSE AVX
  - merge sin/cos/tan solver SSE/AVX/NEON/VMX(le&be) 100% test pass, BG/Q support pending
  - merge fabs integrated like a node merge
